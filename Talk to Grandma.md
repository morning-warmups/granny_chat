# Quiz-3 Talk to Grandma

Granny's hard at hearing.

If you talk to Granny normally, she'll reply "SPEAK UP SONNY JIM"

If you talk to her in ALL CAPS, she'll reply "NO, NOT SINCE 1945"

The year will be a random year between 1930 and 1950.

If you say "BYE" to her she'll reply "What's that honey, I didn't hear you.."
